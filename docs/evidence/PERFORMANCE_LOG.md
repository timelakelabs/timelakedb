# Performance enhancement log

A scheduled agent proposes one performance idea per cycle, implements it,
measures it against a paired baseline, and records the outcome here —
**whether it worked or not**. Failures are the more valuable half: they mark
the paths already explored so the next cycle does not walk them again.

The harness is the referee. Every number below comes from
`bench.py run --backend timelorddb`, never from an ad-hoc measurement, and
every entry names the run labels so the raw records in `bench/results/` can be
re-read.

## Protocol

1. **Read this log first.** Do not repeat an idea already listed as tried,
   unless the entry says why a retry is worthwhile.
2. **One idea per cycle**, stated as a hypothesis with a predicted direction
   and magnitude before any measurement.
3. **Paired runs in the same cycle** on an isolated instance: baseline from
   `master`, then the candidate, both at `--scale laptop` after a `--scale
   smoke` shakeout. Comparing against an older recorded run is not evidence —
   machine conditions drift.
4. **A win must clear the noise floor** and keep the workspace green:
   `cargo test --workspace`, plus `fmt`/`clippy` on the touched files.
5. **Outcome lands on `master` either way** — the change itself when it wins,
   the lessons when it does not.

## Entry format

```
### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM — <short title>            [ADOPTED | REJECTED | ABORTED]
**Hypothesis.**  what should get faster, why, and by roughly how much
**Change.**      what was actually modified (files, mechanism)
**Measurement.** baseline vs candidate, run labels, the metrics that moved
**Verdict.**     the decision and the reasoning behind it
**Lesson.**      what the next cycle should take from this
```

`ADOPTED` — measured a real win, committed. `REJECTED` — no win, or a
regression, or it broke a test; code reverted, lesson kept. `ABORTED` — the
cycle could not complete (build failure, environment problem); says what
blocked it.

## Standing leads

Carried from `CLAUDE.md` and the M4/M5 carve-outs, as starting material:

- **Streaming / range reads.** `LazyTable` loads whole objects; range reads
  over the store would cut both latency and peak memory. The largest known
  lead.
- **Ingest decline under maintenance contention** (intra-run, no cross-run
  decay) — isolation between the maintenance tick and the write path.
- **Shape A p95 608 ms against a 250 ms target**, even with the metadata
  cache making the median 0–6 ms warm.
- **Compaction clustering choice** — currently the highest-cardinality
  dictionary column; is that optimal for the funnel queries too?
- **Flush sizing and Parquet row-group geometry** against the pruning that
  reads them back.
